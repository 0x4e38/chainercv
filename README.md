# ChainerCV

ChainerCV does the dirty work when training a neural network for a computer vision task. In particular, this is a colletion of tools that do following

1. Thin wrappers around common computer vision datasets with support for automatic downloads
2. Composition of data preprocessing (e.g. data augmentation after padding of data)
3. Trainer extensions for computer vision tasks (e.g. visualization of outputs for semantic segmentation)
4. Evaluation metrics for various computer vision tasks
